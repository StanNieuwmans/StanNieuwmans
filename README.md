### Hi 👋

I'm Stan, a young and ambitious student studying Business IT & Management at Windesheim. I have a passion for technology that dates back to my early days of experimenting with the Raspberry Pi. I am now focusing on how to bridge the gap between IT and business, and have recently acquired a marketing certificate to expand my skill set. 

I enjoy applying my knowledge and creativity in design projects, and have experience in using Scrum methodologies. In my free time, I am constantly working on various projects and actively seeking out new technologies to stay up-to-date with the rapidly changing IT industry. 

Currently, I am deep-diving into the field of Machine-Learning as part of my studies, and I am excited to bring my skills and knowledge to new opportunities.


Currently I am working on [Unstocked](https://unstocked.nl/) and [Stufi](https://stufi.app/).
